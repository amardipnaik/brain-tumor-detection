  In bio-medical field, radiology reports are generated day by day in huge amount. Processing of radiology reports is the part of clinical fields. In this paper describes to recognizing and take out the disease from the patient's radiology reports. Methodology includes pre-processing of image, segmentation of image, feature extraction of image and classification by using support vector machine. For image Segmentation using clustering algorithm i.e. k-means clustering and it is used for classification of image with similar features.

In radiography field, large no of radiology reports are generated day by day so for categorizing this reports in different ways by using clustering technique. Clustering techniques is a capable way of navigating and shortening documents have expecting lots of attentions. Radiology reports clustering have been investigated for combination of radiology reports into important clusters, in a sequence to find out essential image features. Clustered a data set making of clustering algorithm for unsupervised and demonstrated different medical domains use different lexical and semantic patterns.</p>
